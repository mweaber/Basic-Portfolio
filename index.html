            <p>Hello! Welcome to my portfolio page. My name is Matthew Weaber and I am currently enrolled in a Full
                Stack
                Boot Camp at the Valencia West Campus.
                I am a Customer Service Engineer for Diebold Nixdorf where I work doing troubleshooting and maintenance
                on
                Automated Teller Machines.
                I live in Kissimmee Florida with my girlfriend Rebecca and our Shiba Inu named Scarlet.

            </p>

            <p>
                My hobbies include coding, video gaming, cooking, and hockey. I am a big hockey fan and have been
                playing
                competitively for 20 years.
                My favorite hockey team is the Florida Panthers, and my favorite player is Aleksander Barkov. I have an
                xbox and enjoy playing MineCraft, Rocket League, and Skyrim in my spare time.
                I enjoy coding, and my classes as I plan to make this my career and show more of my creative side and
                make
                websites and applications that are enjoyed by all.
            </p>

            <p>
