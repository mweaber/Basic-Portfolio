                <p>Hello! Welcome to my portfolio page. My name is Matthew Weaber and I am currently enrolled in a Full
                    Stack
                    Boot Camp at the Valencia West Campus.
                    I am a Customer Service Engineer for Diebold Nixdorf where I work doing troubleshooting and maintenance
                    on
                    Automated Teller Machines.
                    I live in Kissimmee Florida with my girlfriend Rebecca and our Shiba Inu named Scarlet.

                </p>

                <p>
                    My hobbies include coding, video gaming, cooking, and hockey. I am a big hockey fan and have been
                    playing
                    competitively for 20 years.
                    My favorite hockey team is the Florida Panthers, and my favorite player is Aleksander Barkov. I have an
                    xbox and enjoy playing MineCraft, Rocket League, and Skyrim in my spare time.
                    I enjoy coding, and my classes as I plan to make this my career and show more of my creative side and
                    make
                    websites and applications that are enjoyed by all.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My personal goals for the next five to ten years are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>To finish the Full Stack Boot Camp and find work in the field.</li>
                        <li>To buy a home for myself and my family</li>
                        <li>Have a vacation outside the continental United States</li>
                        <li>Explore a new hobby such as:</li>
